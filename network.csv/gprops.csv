description,"A set of networks of HIV transmissions between people through sexual, needle-sharing, or social connections, based on combining 8 datasets collected from 1988 to 2001. Metadata includes test results of several diseases, as well as demographic variables such as age, ethnicity, and gender. Networks come in two flavors: egodyads and altdyads. Egodyads are the network among study-participants and their direct partners. Altdyads are the network among people who are connected to the egodyad network. All data contained in a single file, but individual networks can be extracted using the 'studynum' variable (see codebook)."
